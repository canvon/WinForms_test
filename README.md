Windows Forms (on Mono on GNU/Linux) test/proof-of-concept experiments


## LogViewer

(Begin of June 2016)

  * Reproduce a LogUserControl I did elsewhere, then try to bugfix things.
    A change away from using a ListView inside can be found in branch
    experimental/RichTextBox

  * Utilize the ReadLogSafe() idiom I learned from Sven.


## DfViewer

(October 2016)

  * Try out ListView OwnerDraw, by writing a graphical viewer for
    df ("disk free") status.

  * For screenshots, see [DfViewer development history on the Wiki](
    https://github.com/canvon/WinForms_test/wiki/DfViewer_history).
